# ASR
Automatic Sound Recognition is tool which transcripts the Human Voice into Text, In order to run the code file ASR.ipynb.

You need to install anaconda first.

Within anaconda comes a tool named jupyter notebook, you will open the file in that.

After download the dataset from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/medical-speech-transcription-and-intent, 
Make sure these libraries are installed in your system: Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Opencv (CV2) , Keras, Tensorflow, Librosa, Matplotlib, Scipy, Ipython.

You have to make sure your system have around 8 gb ram in order to run the code with limited data (as in above code file), for complete data you need to have more than 32 gb of ram.

run the code cell by cell to preprocess and train the model.
